## General info/ Instructions
Task 1: Header 
Use existing HTML tags to create a new header.  This header should stretch completely across the screen, and as users scroll up and down the page the header should remain at the top of the page.  When the page loads, it should not cover any content on the page, though it may cover content as users scroll down.  The header should be filled with a single solid color of your choosing, and should have your name centered (horizontally and vertically) in the header.  All other attributes (height, etc.) can be determined by you. Tip: you will not need to use the <header> tag, but may play with it if you choose to.
<br>
Task 2: Flex Columns 
Create 100 boxes using HTML and CSS.  These boxes should be different colors (at least 3), and a different color from the header (so you can copy and paste the same box 100 times.)  Using CSS flex, put the boxes into 3 different columns that are equally spaced apart.  The final row should not shrink or stretch out: all boxes should be uniform, even if there are not enough to complete a final row.
<br>
Task 3: Table with Contact Information
At the bottom of the page, add a table that includes at least 1 way to contact you: one column should say what form of contact this is (email, phone number, Github, school email, etc), the other is the actual information.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
